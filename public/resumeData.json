    "bio":"Are you looking for an 'expert' blockchain developer that actually knows what he is talking about? Look, I know what you're probably going through right now: Perhaps you’re looking to create an NFT project, a new ICO or to customize a smart contract for your platform Now, the one thing that all of these solutions have in common is that they’re designed to fulfill an important need in your business. Ultimately, the reason why anyone decides to get involved into a blockchain project is to MAKE MONEY - whether that’s by creating the most popular NFT platform or by creating a cryptocurrency that will be used for transactions by millions of users Now maybe, you’re not really sure where to start. And perhaps, you’re not too sure that the “cheap” freelancers you see out there in Upwork will provide you with the best solution you are looking for right now See, there’s a big distinction between someone who just executes on requirements without keeping the end in mind… And a critical thinker, a seasoned specialist, who can think outside the box to provide you with the ***perfect*** solution your project needs right now. My name is Houston Barrows, and after working for more than 5 years in the blockchain business, I’ve come up with the perfect formula to create crypto projects that truly revolutionize the industry I’m talking about projects that fully leverage the power of cutting-edge technologies to create User Experiences that accurately fulfill any pressing need within your users with the most secure standards So, if you’re looking for a new crypto project, built with clean code, with a beautiful design, all built to take your business to the next level, you can contact me here and we can schedule a quick call.",
